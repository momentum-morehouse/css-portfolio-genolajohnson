<a><p><h3>GEBJohnson</h3></p></a>
<br>I’ve successfully found my purpose. Originally, I didn’t want to be in education, however, it found me. I wanted to help others. And, I really enjoy teaching. <br>
<br>I liked being about to create systems and processes for students to understand a concept. Somehow, my purpose got lost in the shuffle of weekly lesson plans aligning to a test that I wasn’t even sure would actually help my students become productive citizens in today’s global society.<br>

<a><p><h3>GBJWriting Services</h3></p></a>
I’m Genola Johnson, a Website Copywriter, Email Sequencing and Content Strategies who loves to craft words to meet a client’s heartstrings.<br>

<br>I help small businesses and creative entrepreneurs communicate with their clients needs and desires through their brand voice and conversions through copywriting and content creation.<br>

<br>Having the right words is great, but no strategy, the words fall on deaf ears (blind eyes). This is where I come in to help you with the right strategy.<br>

<br>Okay, that’s my Writing Side, I do have another life. I help people focus on their career GEBJohnson and I’m a podcaster, The GEBJohnson Podcast.<br>

<br>Believe it or not, I do have down time, a family with 2 daughters, and awesome husband, who’s watching the books. We live in a small town in the suburbs of south Atlanta!<br>

<a><p><h3>GEBJohnson Podcasts</h3></p></a>
  <br>The GEBJohnson Podcast is truly a podcast that is published to help you figure out your purpose, figure out opportunities out there and how to get there.<br>
